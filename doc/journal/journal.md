# Meeting protocol 

## \#01: February 18, 2020 - Introduction
### Formal and technical questions
* Use of LaTeX for project documentation? -> ok.
* Interests expressed in volumetric rendering, 3D noise cube generation, signed distance functions (SDF) and surface normal estimation algorithms. Advanced topic to look in to: subsurface scattering.

### Meeting discussion
Gitlab repository [cloud-shader](https://gitlab.ti.bfh.ch/cpvr-students/cloud-shader) should be used as storage for all project files.

**Documentation guidelines**
* The document is supposed to be rather technical. There is no need for general introduction to what a shader is, for example.

**Tasks**
* Read published papers about real-time cloud rendering
* Compare popular techniques and methods

Next meeting is scheduled for March 2, 2020 at 3pm.

**Time log**

| Task | time spent |
|----|---|
| Setup of latex work environment | 4h |
| Initial draft of specification document | 4h |
| Research on existing papers about cloud rendering | 1h |

## \#02: March 2, 2020
### Formal and technical questions
* Meeting protocol okay in form of markdown?
* Keep project requirement specification separate from main document?
* When is the deadline of the project submission?

### Meeting discussion

**Tasks**
* Rename the repository from "cloud-shader" to "2020-cloud-shader".
* The meeting of April 13th, 2020 will be moved to **April 14th, 2020 at 3:30 pm**.
* Finish final draft of specification.tex by March 13th, 2020 and send it to the tutor.


**Remarks about the specification.tex**
* In "Scope of Work", add subsection "Vision". This should contain a short description of what this project could be followed with / long-term goals.
* Add section "Requirements" containing subsections
    * "Research requirements": what to research?
    * "Develop requirements": Define what prototypes should be implemented. Each prototype should derive from a requirement, which again derives from a goal. Also "Evaluation of libs" could be a requirement.
* Add section "Testing"
* In "Results", add subsection "Presentation". This should contain information about the presentation occuring on the second last friday of the term, during school time.
* Add more images. At least in "Vision", add an image showing how I would like the prototypes to look like.

Next meeting is scheduled for March 16, 2020 at 3pm.


**Time log**

| Task | time spent |
|----|---|
| Updated document in regards of the discussed remarks | 8h |
