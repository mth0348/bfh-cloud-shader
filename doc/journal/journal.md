# Meeting protocol 

## \#01: February 18, 2020 - Introduction
### Formal and technical questions
* Use of LaTeX for project documentation? -> ok.
* Interests expressed in volumetric rendering, 3D noise cube generation, signed distance functions (SDF) and surface normal estimation algorithms. Advanced topic to look in to: subsurface scattering.

### Meeting discussion
Gitlab repository [cloud-shader](https://gitlab.ti.bfh.ch/cpvr-students/cloud-shader) should be used as storage for all project files.

**Documentation guidelines**
* The document is supposed to be rather technical. There is no need for general introduction to what a shader is, for example.

**Tasks**
* Read published papers about real-time cloud rendering
* Compare popular techniques and methods

Next meeting is scheduled for March 2nd, 2020 at 3pm.
