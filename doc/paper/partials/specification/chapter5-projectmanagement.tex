\section{Project management}

\subsection{Schedule}
The time frame of the semester spans over exactly 16 weeks. Being worth 4 ECTS points, this project assumes a maximum work load of 8 hours per week, resulting in a total of 128 hours. 
\vspace{\baselineskip}
\\
Over the course of the term, the project will be split into four primary task groups, namely organization, research, prototyping and finalization.
Put into relation with the duration of the project, the estimated schedule looks like this:

The milestones \emph{Prototype finished} for prototypes 1, 2, and 3 are referring to the prototypes about \gls{volumetricrendering}, \gls{noise} and \gls{raymarching}, respectively.
\\
\vspace{\baselineskip}
During research and prototyping, the documentation will be continuously updated.
\\
For each task group, the following distribution of time and effort is estimated:
\newline

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Task group}  & \textbf{Predicted effort}\\ \hline
    Organization        & 10\%                      \\ \hline
    Research            & 35\%                      \\ \hline
    Prototyping         & 50\%                      \\ \hline
    Finalizing          & 5\%                       \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{Project Results}

\subsubsection{Documentation}
The following documents must be submitted for grading:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Requirement specification
    \item Project documentation indcluding:
