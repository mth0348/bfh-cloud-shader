\subsection{Noise Generation}
\label{section:noise-generation}
Nature's unpredictability and plays a big role in the diversity and appearance of cloudscapes. In shaders, an approach to that \textit{randomness} is used called \textit{\gls{noise}}.
In order to be able to implement random \gls{noise}, several important topics need to be looked into. It is best to start with randomness in computer science and how it is handled inside a shader program.

\subsubsection{Random Numbers}
As expected, there is no magic function which returns a pure random number inside the seemingly predictable and rigid code environment.
So the question arises how to generate randomness, or at least an approximation to it.
