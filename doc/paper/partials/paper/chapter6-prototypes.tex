\section{Prototypes and Results}

\subsection{First Draft}
The first drafts of prototypes created during this project all revolve around volumetric rendering. 
Instead of using a \gls{sdf}, a noise function was used. The primary issue was to get the cube transparent where the noise function would return a number close to 0.0 and to color it where the noise function returns number close to 1.0.
