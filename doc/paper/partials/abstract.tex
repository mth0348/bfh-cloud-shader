\section*{Abstract}
In many games, clouds contribute a great deal to the overall ambience and can be the cherry on top by filling the sky with life.
To get as close as possible to real clouds, this project engages in researching and prototyping a \gls{procedural}, volumetric cloud shader.
\\
In order to achieve \gls{volumetricrendering}, the document dives into the concept of \gls{raymarching}, a set of methods used to render a 3D data set inside a container cube, making it appear volumetric.
Different methods are expanded on, like constant step, traditional, and sphere-traced \gls{raymarching}. In addition, to accomplish a feel of depth,
